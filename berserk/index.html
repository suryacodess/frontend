            <h2>Guts is a lone warrior who was born from a hanged corpse and raised as a mercenary by his abusive
                adoptive father Gambino after the death of his adoptive mother, Shisu. It came to a head when Guts was
                forced to kill a drunk Gambino in self-defense, fleeing his mercenary group and becoming a wandering
                sellsword. His fearsome reputation catches the attention of Griffith, the charismatic leader of a
                mercenary group known as the Band of the Hawk. Griffith forces Guts to join the group after defeating
                him in battle, with Guts becoming his best fighter and main confidante. The Band is hired by the kingdom
                of Midland to help in its century-long war against the Chuder Empire. Guts learns of Griffith's desire
                to rule a kingdom of his own and his mysterious pendant known as a Behelit. The Behelit is instrumental
                when they are spared by Nosferatu Zodd, a monstrous immortal who leaves Guts with a cryptic warning of a
                painful demise for being Griffith's friend.</h2>
